                                        <p>CGGAP organized a significant campaign against shrinking civic space on December 8, 2023, bringing together 3 Members of Parliament (MPs) with CSO representatives, students, academicians, and researchers. Esteemed leaders Hon. Pradip Paudel (Nepali Congress), Hon. Sunita Baral (CPN-UML), and Hon. Santosh Pariyar (Rashtriya Swatantra Party) led this special discussion series, ensuring balanced representation from both government and opposition parties. The event successfully facilitated open dialogue between civil society leaders, youth activists, and parliamentary representatives, addressing key challenges in civic space and exploring potential solutions. The diverse participation from NGOs, INGOs, civil society organizations, student leaders, and legal experts enriched the discourse, creating an inclusive environment for constructive conversation between CSOs and political representatives.</p>

                                        <p>CGGAP organized National Observatorio Workshop comprising development practitioners, media professionals and researchers, as it served as a capacity development initiative for civil society organizations (CSOs) and peoples' organizations. The workshop introduced the CSO Aid Observatorio Training Handbook, which aimed to increase the capacities and skills of CSOs in development cooperation work. Additionally, the workshop provided a platform for members to share best practices on CSO partnerships and exercise people's research that would directly benefit the CSO Aid Observatorio Platform. Furthermore, the objectives of the National Observatorio Workshop align with promoting awareness and transparency on the management of aid, assisting engagement of CSOs with governments and other providers, and facilitating shared learning and discourse among CSOs, policymakers, academia, media, and activists. The outputs of the Workshop, such as Activity related to the Handbook, CSO Reports to the Observatorio Platform, Deep Dives or Policy Briefs, and Policy & Advocacy Initiatives, will also be valuable for CPDE.</p>

                                        <p>CGGAP organized Multistakeholder Dialogue on CSO Effectiveness, voiced jointly by civil society stakeholders for shaping the development effectiveness mechanism in countries with immense shrinking civic space. Some of our interventions were discussion on the role of government, as they are the distinctive contributors to development effectiveness and administer their work by CSOs as watchdog, and media entities as informed participatory units towards the dissemination of tools for development effectiveness. Nonetheless, these interventions were sidelined in the past as there was a constant debate on the identity and the roles of CSOs and media as development actors, particularly in regard to democratic movements and promoting development effectiveness. At the same time, there was some evidence where the knowledge about issues surrounding development effectiveness among civil society organizations themselves seemed very limited. Therefore, this workshop strove for bridging a gap of knowledge by addressing issues concerning the recognition and role of CSOs, government sector, and media towards highlighting issues of the development effectiveness agenda among broader circles of the development community. Another intervention was the discussion on limited representation of CSOs particularly those engaged in the issues of women, children, Dalits, indigenous people, tribal, differently able persons, sexual minorities, senior citizens and other excluded groups in policy making process and fundamental problems of multistakeholder approach towards enhancing the continuation of development effectiveness in the future.</p>

                                        <p>In preparation for the 2022 Effective Development Cooperation Summit in Geneva, Switzerland in December, Mr. Upakar Pandey, Project Coordinator of Center for Good Governance and Peace (CGGAP) participated in two-day conference on October 24 and 25 to discuss the state of enabling environment for CSOs in the region and the Triple Nexus approach to conflict. Organized by the Asia constituency of the CSO Partnership for Development Effectiveness (CPDE), Reality of Aid-Asia Pacific (RoA-AP) and Sustainable Development Foundation (SDF), the activity was titled "Regional conference on promoting CSO effectiveness through trust building" and brought together 23 participants in Bangkok, Thailand and 25 online participants. The conference tackled the state of CSO enabling environment in the region and held a workshop on CSOs' main demands for improving this environment. The workshop groups highlighted the indispensable role of CSOs in development actions, and the need for governments and the private sector to trust CSOs' adherence to this role based on development effectiveness principles and objectives. The conference also featured a discussion and a workshop on the localization of the Triple Nexus approach, which highlights the combination of humanitarian, development and peace actions in addressing the root causes of conflict. The workshop output will form the Asia-Pacific CSOs' Key Asks which will then be presented by CPDE to the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation's 2022 Effective Development Co-operation Summit.</p>

                                        <p>Good management can't save a bad project, but poor management can easily ruin a good one. This course took project management to the next level, using real life humanitarian and development projects to dive deeper into what tools, processes, and strategies are needed to ensure the right project is delivered to the right population, on time and on budget. Over the 3-day training, the participants critically analyzed case study documents from complex projects in the sector and work through the project cycle to understand how different tools can be used in practical terms at each stage.</p>

                                        <p>This training was designed to improve the leadership skills of humanitarians who are working in management or coordination roles. It drew on the latest research by authorities such as ministries, into the skills required to be an effective leader. Sessions combined theory with practical exercises, providing opportunities for participants to develop their skills in a controlled environment. An on-going case study was used throughout the course enabling trainees to further practice their leadership skills in realistic situations, while considering the challenges faced by senior team members in a humanitarian emergency. The training also offered participants the opportunity to reflect on their personal leadership skills and outline a personal development plan created with supportive peer coaching.</p>
